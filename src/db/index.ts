    instructions: "Make the quinoa: combine the quinoa and water in a sauce pan and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer (medium-low), stir the quinoa, then cover it and cook for 10 to 15 minutes until all of the water has been absorbed.  Remove it from the heat, let it sit for 5 minutes, then fluff it up with a fork.  Cool the quinoa a bit before making the salad.  The quinoa can be made several days in advance and kept in the fridge if needed before using.\nMake the dressing: Combine the yogurt, tahini, lemon juice, and a pinch of sea salt in a bowl and whisk until smooth.  Thin the dressing out with a bit of water if it is too thick.  Set aside.\nMake the salad:  Combine the quinoa, snap peas, radishes, and parsley in a bowl.  Pour over about half of the dressing, then toss to combine.  Taste the salad and add more dressing or sea salt if desired.  Enjoy at room temperature or chilled.  Makes 3 to 4 main dish servings or 6 to 8 side servings.",

    instructions: "<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the bell peppers lengthwise, remove the seeds and stems.  Lightly oil the bell peppers by tossing them in a bowl with some grapeseed oil or olive oil.  Place the peppers on a baking sheet skin-side down. Roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes until the edges begin to show some color.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.</li><li>While the peppers are roasting, prepare your stuffing.  Place the cream cheese, walnuts, garlic, salt, sriracha and black pepper in a bowl and mix until creamy (I used a fork to mash the ingredients together but Im sure this can be done in a food processor or mixer). Add the green onion and fold in to the cream cheese until combined.  Test the cream cheese for flavor. If you would like, add more salt and/or sriracha.</li><li>Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Use a spoon (or a piping bag) to stuff the peppers liberally and place them back on the baking sheet.  There is enough stuffing here to really pack those suckers up, so you dont need to worry about the amount of cream cheese youre portioning out.  If the cream cheese is very soft, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow it to set up. If not, place pop the peppers in the oven and bake about 8 minutes.  Change oven setting to high broil and bake an additional 2 minutes, until the tops of the cream cheese begin to brown (If theyre already brown at this point, skip the broiling).</li><li>Put on a pretty plate and serve to your friends.</li></ol>",

    instructions: "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In a medium bowl, combine the peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla and 2 tablespoons of the coconut flour until well blended. Add additional coconut flour if the peanut mixture is too soft  it should be pliable and easy to form into shapes with your hands.Using a tablespoon or ice cream scoop, drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Form into balls and flatten each ball slightly with your fingers. Place in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes until firm.Melt the chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring often, until melted. Let cool for a few minutes and then dip each of the frozen peanut butter pieces into the chocolate to coat completely. Using a fork is a good way to do this and be sure to work quickly.Transfer each peanut butter cup back to the baking sheet and return to the freezer. Sprinkle with a little coarse sea salt if desired. Chill until set, about 1 hour or more. These will keep well in the freezer for several days, if they last that long.Note: You can make a half batch instead, but these are so good, you won't want to do that, especially as they keep so well.",
